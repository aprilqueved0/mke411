FOR PAST 8 YEARS SINCE COMING BACK TO MILWAUKEE AND NEIGHBOR HOOD I HAVE RESIDED ON THE CORNER OF 58TH AND VLIET IN A 4 FAMILY RENTAL UNIT. . 58TH STREET ALONG WITH BOTH 57TH STREET, AND 59TH STREET ARE  AND HAVE BEEN IN DEPLORABLE CONDITION. SEVERAL TIMES I HAVE CONTACTED ALDERMAN MURPHY BEFORE HIS RETIREMENT TO REPORT SOME HUGE POT HOLES AND GENERALLY HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS OF THE STREETS, IN PARTICULAR 58TH STREET FROM VLIET STREET SOUTH TO THE ENTRANCE TO HAWTHORNE GLEN PARK. ALDERMAN MURPHY ALWAYS RESPONDED BY SENDING OUT A DPW CREW TO PATCH UP THE WORST OF THE POT HOLES AND TERRIBLE CONDITION OF 58TH STREET ONLY TO HAVE THE PATCHES QUICKLY DISAPPEAR OR JUST PLACING A BAND AIDE ON A MUCH MORE SEVERE GENERAL STREET CONDITION. THERE IS NO WAY TO DRIVE DOWN 58TH SOUTH FROM VLIET STREET AVOIDING MULTIPLE POT HOLES AND GENERALLY TERRIBLE ROAD SURFACE. ARE THERE ANY PLANS TO AT LEAST CONSIDER THE LESS COSTLY RESURFACING PROCESS THAT THE CITY HAS EMPLOYED ON CERTAIN STREETS IN THE CITY TO APPLY A SMOOTHER AND SAGER DRIVING SERVICE WITHOUT COMPLETE STREET, CURB, SIDEWALK REPLACEMENT. ITS TRULY A SITUATION THAT HAS GONE ON FAR TOO LONG AND I WILL BEGIN TO GATHER SIGNATURES OR TESTIMONIES FROM MY NEIGHBORS TO VALIDATE MY CONCERNS.

THE FLASHING BLUE LIGHT FROM THIS CAMERA CART SHINES DIRECTLY PAST MY CLOSED BLINDS AND INTO MY APARTMENT AT NIGHT, LOCATED FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD AT 902 S 25TH ST. THIS CONSTANT AND DISRUPTIVE LIGHT HAS MADE IT DIFFICULT TO SLEEP AND HAS BECOME A SIGNIFICANT NUISANCE.

I ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT MCDONALD'S DIRECTLY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY, I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY RESPONSE. I ALSO CALLED THEIR CORPORATE TOLL-FREE NUMBER, BUT NO ONE ANSWERED THAT CALL EITHER. I AM NOT SURE WHETHER MCDONALD'S WILL TAKE ACTION ON THEIR OWN, SO I AM REACHING OUT TO YOUR DEPARTMENT IN HOPES THAT YOU CAN HELP RESOLVE THIS SITUATION.

I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST THAT THE FLASHING BLUE LIGHT BE TURNED OFF DURING THE NIGHT OR THAT THE CAMERA CART BE MOVED TO ANOTHER PART OF THE PARKING LOT WHERE THE LIGHT DOES NOT AFFECT NEARBY RESIDENTS. THIS ISSUE IS CAUSING UNNECESSARY DISTURBANCE AND DISCOMFORT, AND I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY ASSISTANCE YOU CAN PROVIDE IN ADDRESSING IT.

OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS, I HAVE NOTICED THE PRESENCE OF ONE OR TWO MICE ON AND OFF WITHIN THE APARTMENT, AND DESPITE MY REPEATED CONCERNS TO MY LANDLORD, **DEVOE RENTALS LLC**, THE ISSUE HAS NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED.

I HAVE INFORMED THE LANDLORD ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS ABOUT THE MICE PROBLEM, BUT THEIR RESPONSE HAS BEEN DISMISSIVE AND LACKING IN ACTION. THEY HAVE OFFERED EXCUSES AND HAVE NOT TAKEN ANY CONCRETE STEPS TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. AS A TENANT, I AM PAYING **$450 PER MONTH** FOR THIS RENTAL, AND I BELIEVE IT IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR THE LANDLORD TO IGNORE THIS SERIOUS HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERN.

I UNDERSTAND THAT **DEVOE RENTALS LLC** HAS A HISTORY OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS WITH YOUR DEPARTMENT, AND I AM REQUESTING THAT APPROPRIATE ACTION BE TAKEN AGAINST THIS LANDLORD FOR THEIR FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THE PROPERTY IN A HABITABLE CONDITION. THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF PESTS IN MY APARTMENT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR ME TO LIVE IN THE SPACE COMFORTABLY, AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO ENDURE THIS WHILE PAYING RENT.

I AM ASKING THAT YOU INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER FURTHER AND HOLD THE LANDLORD ACCOUNTABLE FOR NOT ADDRESSING THE ISSUE. IT IS NOT FAIR TO CONTINUE TO PAY RENT IN THESE CONDITIONS WHEN THEY HAVE NOT TAKEN THE NECESSARY STEPS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM.

THE ISSUE IS THAT THE BATHTUB IN THIS BATHROOM FILLS WITH WATER WHENEVER THE SHOWER HEAD IS IN USE, FOR NO APPARENT REASON. I AM UNSURE WHETHER THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUE THAT HAS NOT BEEN REPORTED PREVIOUSLY, OR IF IT IS A NEW PROBLEM THAT HAS GONE UNNOTICED. REGARDLESS, IT IS CAUSING INCONVENIENCE AND CONCERNS REGARDING POTENTIAL WATER DAMAGE OR FURTHER PLUMBING COMPLICATIONS.

I HAVE INFORMED MY LANDLORD, **DEVOE RENTALS LLC**, ABOUT THIS PROBLEM ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, BUT THEY HAVE REFUSED TO TAKE ANY ACTION OR ADDRESS THE ISSUE IN ANY WAY. THIS LACK OF RESPONSE HAS PROMPTED ME TO REACH OUT TO YOUR DEPARTMENT FOR ASSISTANCE.

ADDITIONALLY, I HAVE COME TO LEARN THAT DEVOE RENTALS LLC HAS A **HISTORY OF COMPLAINTS WITH THE MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT OF NEIGHBORHOOD SERVICES**. IT APPEARS THAT THEY HAVE A PATTERN OF NEGLECTING TENANT CONCERNS AND PROVIDING SUBSTANDARD LIVING CONDITIONS WHILE CONTINUING TO COLLECT RENT PAYMENTS FROM HARD-WORKING MILWAUKEE RESIDENTS. IT IS DISHEARTENING TO SEE THAT THESE LANDLORDS APPEAR TO OPERATE WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE WELL-BEING OR SAFETY OF THEIR TENANTS.

GIVEN THE SERIOUS NATURE OF THE PLUMBING ISSUE, THE LANDLORD’S FAILURE TO ADDRESS IT, AND THEIR HISTORY OF NEGLECT, I AM REQUESTING THAT THE **MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT OF NEIGHBORHOOD SERVICES INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER** AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY ASSISTANCE YOU CAN PROVIDE IN ENSURING THAT THIS ISSUE IS RESOLVED IN A TIMELY AND PROFESSIONAL MANNER.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS COMPLAINT. I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR PROMPT RESPONSE AND RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER.",108,"902 S 25TH ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53204-0000","c(-87.94468303581, 43.021690115808)",21,CLARKE SQUARE,5,OPEN

KEVIN THROWS FOOD ON THE SIDE WALK AND WITHIN HIS FRONT YARD INCLUDING: PORK KNUCKLE BONES, RIBS, TURKEY CARCASSES, RICE, CORN FLAKES, VARIOUS FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, EGGS, MARSHMELLOS, HOT DOG BUNS, BAGLES, AND OTHER PRODUCTS TO NAME A FEW WHICH ARE LEFT OVERS HE RECEIVES FROM THE FOOD PANTRY. THIS LEFTOVER WASTE ENDS UP IN MY FRONT AND BACK YARD OR UNDER MY CAR, INCLUDING THE BONES AND SCRAPS. THIS HAS ALSO ATTRACTED UNWANTED RODENTS AND OTHER VERMIN TO THE AREA, INCLUDING EXCESS SQUIRRELS, RACCOONS, CROWS, MICE, AND FURTHERMORE ATTRACTED THE STRAY CAT POPULATION.

AT FIRST MY LANDLORD WAS VERY RESPONSIVE AND SEEMED TO CARE. THE FIRST MOLD SPECIALIST THAT HE SENT LOOKED AT THE ROOM AND SAID “OH, IT’S A SAFE MOLD, IF THERE IS ANY MOLD” AND DID NO TESTING WHATSOEVER.
